        WHAT the visualizations show: The main visualization seen on the webpage
        is a preliminary version of our main visualization. We tested different
        libraries and selected relevant and interesting correlations to show in a
        sun-like shape that we will still rework for the final version.
      </p>
      <p>
        WHO the visualization is for: Anyone with an interest in the overall topic
        of happiness and factors that might have an influence on it. It could be
        specifically interesting to people from Europe or residing in Europe since
        the survey responses are limited to participants from Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
        WHY we the audience should care about it: We aim to raise an awareness
        about the strength of correlations of a variety of factors in relation to
        people’s happiness and overall well being. In our final visualization, we
        plan to encourage personal reflection before revealing the data
        visualization (Which 3 factors do you think impact your happiness the
        most? Which 3 factors do you think have the strongest correlation with the
        average European’s happiness?) to encourage people to actively think about
        the topic, reflect on their behaviour and potentially reveal
        misconceptions.
