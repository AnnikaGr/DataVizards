          <b> WHAT</b>
          the visualizations show: The visualizations show correlations between
          various factors and the corresponding people's answers about their
          happiness levels, for cases where the correlations were stronger than
          0.2. They are visualized in a polar area chart resembling a sun and
          sorted clockwise based on correlation strength. On demand, users can
          also see line charts for the factors with the strongest correlations
          to happiness.

          <b>WHO</b>
          the visualization is for: Anyone with an interest in the overall topic
          of happiness and factors that might have an influence on it. It could
          be specifically interesting to people from Europe or residing in
          Europe since the survey responses are limited to participants from
          Europe.

          <b>WHY</b>
          we the audience should care about it: We aim to raise an awareness
          about the strength of correlations of a variety of factors in relation
          to peopleâ€™s happiness and overall well being. We aim to encourage
          personal reflection before revealing the data visualization to
          encourage people to actively think about the topic, reflect on the
          factors relating to their happiness and potentially reveal
          misconceptions. Further, it could increase the overall relevancy,
          understanding and memorability of the data we show them afterwards.
